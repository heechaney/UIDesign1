<dt>Animal Crossing game pack</dt>
  <dd>I know I'm pretty late to the game, but I started playing the game this Wednesday; and boy it IS addicting. I just can't drop the controller, and I keep playing on and on and on. From the cute, adorable characters to the town building aspect of the game makes this game so attractive and keep players to get ahold of it. </dd>

  <dt>Macbook</dt>
    <dd>When it comes to switching devices, I tend to use them quite long and try to make the most of it. I've been using this laptop since late 2016, and it's getting pretty outdated. The battery life  is getting low everyday, and I always need to carry the charger. It gets overheated too easily, and it's steaming hot when I touch the top of the keyboard when I use it for more than a few hours. I'm not sure how long will I be able to use this one.</dd>

  <dt>Laptop Charger</dt>
    <dd>A life support for my laptop. Must bring it everywhere  if I want to use the laptop.</dd>
  <br>
  <dt>HDMI/USB adapter</dt>
    <dd>Iâ€™ve got so many things to gripe about my laptop. Another thing that ticks me off is that my laptop doesn't have a HDMI or a USB port, so it's always hard to either share or present stuff if I don't have the adapter. This one is also always in my bag for that reason; I better have it than to be sorry.</dd>
