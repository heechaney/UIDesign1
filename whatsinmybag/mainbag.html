<dt>Porter bag</dt>
  <dd>I got this bag back in March when I was visiting Tokyo. I’ve been using this beaten up laptop bag for quite awhile and it was quite unbearable to carry it around. It’s kinda odd to carry a bag inside a bag but I personally have no problem with it. (click the photo to see inside)</dd>
  <br>
  <dt>Sketchbook</dt>
    <dd>I carry this sketchbook around everywhere I go, even if I don’t end up drawing anything. I’ve been using the same kind of sketchbook since 2019 (around when I enrolled for military service). It’s compact but also quite space, so it feels nice to draw on it. I made a personal zine with the illustrations I drew on the sketchbook in 2021.</dd>

    <dd>A cool looking hat, no further details.</dd>
  <br>
  <dt>iPad Pro</dt>
    <dd>I’ve been using iPad Pro since late 2016. It was the first generation and was pretty sturdy when using drawing applications compared to the recent M1-M2 iPads. iPad really helped me (along with my sketchbook) to get through my military service, and be more productive instead of just spending meaningless times. This one, I got it last year (2022) due to the previous one overheating too often and I needed a better performing one. I've enjoyed using it so far and hope to use it for years to come.</dd>
